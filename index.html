    <h2><center>THE PLASTIC PROBLEM</center></h2>
    
    <p><Center><h4>
       We're surrounded by plastic. It’s in the single-use packaging we discard,
       the consumer goods that fill our stores, and in our clothing, which sheds 
       microplastic fibers in the wash.
       In the first decade of this century, we made more plastic than all the
       plastic in history up to the year 2000. And every year, billions of
       pounds of more plastic end up in the world's oceans. Studies estimate
       there are now <u>15–51 trillion pieces of plastic</u> in the world's oceans
       — from the equator to the poles, from Arctic ice sheets to the sea 
       floor. Not one square mile of surface ocean anywhere on earth is free of plastic pollution.
       The problem is growing into a crisis. The fossil fuel industry plans to 
       increase plastic production by 40 percent over the next decade. These oil
       giants are rapidly building petrochemical plants across the United States 
       to turn fracked gas into plastic. This means more toxic air pollution and 
       plastic in our oceans.
       We need urgent action to address the global plastic pollution epidemic.

        Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects
        and particles in the Earth's environment that adversely affects wildlife,
        wildlife habitat, and humans. Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized
        into micro-, meso-, or macro debris, based on size.Plastic is a synthetic organic
        polymer made from petroleum with properties ideally suited for a wide variety of 
        applications, including packaging, building and construction, household and sports
        equipment, vehicles, electronics and agriculture. Plastic is cheap, lightweight, 
        strong and malleable. Over 300 million tons of plastic are produced every year,
        half of which is used to design single-use items such as shopping bags, cups and straws.
        At least 8 million tons of plastic end up in our oceans every year. Floating plastic 
        debris are currently the most abundant items of marine litter. Waste plastic makes
        up 80% of all marine debris from surface waters to deep-sea sediments. Plastic has
        been detected on shorelines of all the continents, with more plastic materials 
        found near popular tourist destinations and densely populated areas.

    <h3><center>Effect of plastic pollution on humans</center></h3>

    <p><center><h4>

        Microplastics entering the human body via direct exposures 
        through ingestion or inhalation can lead to an array of health impacts,
        including inflammation, genotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and 
        necrosis, which are linked to an array of negative health outcomes including cancer,
        cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes,
        rheumatoid arthritis, chronic inflammation, auto-immune conditions, neuro-degenerative diseases, and stroke.
        Scientists have found microplastics in 114 marine species, and almost one-third of these end up on our plates.
        Some of the chemicals added to plastic to increase its performance are considered endocrine disruptors – chemicals
        that affect normal hormone function – while some retardants may interfere with brain development in children.
        Studying the impacts of microplastics on human health is very challenging. Today we know very little about what
        levels of contamination might negatively affect us. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization stated 
        following recent research – that people are likely to consume only negligible amounts of microplastics from fish.
        Nonetheless, scientists remain concerned about the human health impacts of marine plastics. More research needs to
        be carried out before we are truly able to understand the implications of consuming contaminated fish.
        But it’s quite clear that this cannot possibly be a good addition to our diets. With every passing day,
        as we consume more contaminated seafood, plastic pollution affects human health, even if these effects
        have not manifested just yet.

      Hungry animals usually smell food in plastic containers and bags. However, their curiosity and 
      desire for food often cause them to get their heads, feet or wings trapped in the plastic. 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpRULZQ0x2Y&t">While animals stuck in plastic becomes viral on the internet</a>
       doesn't change the fact  that animals may suffer from overheating, suffocation, dehydration, starvation, and eventually
        death. In the case where the limbs of animals are trapped, 
      it makes them less agile and more vulnerable to predators, competitors, and environmental stress.
